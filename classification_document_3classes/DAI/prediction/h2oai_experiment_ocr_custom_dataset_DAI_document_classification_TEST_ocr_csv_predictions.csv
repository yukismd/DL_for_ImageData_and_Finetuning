SUMMARY--We described 749 tumors from 6 sources of rats raised at 7 laboratories.The sources were
""Sprague-Dawley from 4 commercial suppliersOsborne-Mendel,and Oregon.Highly significant differ-
ences in the incidences of endocrine and mammary tumors were found. There were significant variations in.
the incidences of adrenal medullary tumors among rats from the same source raised at 2 laboratories. Of
the rats with endocrine tumons,9-15% had tumors in  or more endocrine glands.All but 1 of the testicular
tumors occurred in Oregon rats.Thyroid and pitultary tumors
were more common in femalesy adrenal medul-
lary and islet cell tumors of the pancreas were more frequent in males. Brain tumors occurred more often
and at a younger age and were more apt to cause symptoms in males than in females. The incidence of
tumors in ""Sprague-Dawley"" rats from different commercial sources varied as much from each other as
from the other ""strains."" Factors that can affect the incidence of tumors and the difficulties in comparing
the rates of incidence reported in the literature were discussed. We stressed the need for extreme caution
in evaluation of carcinogenicity studies conducted at different laboratories and/or on rats from different
sources.JNat Cancer lnst 50:1243-12571973.

Adherence of Euzamoeba h/stolyrica trophozoites to host cells is mediated by a galactose (Gal) and
N-acetylgalactosamine (Ga!NAc)-specific surlace lectin. The lectin is a heterodimeric protein composed of heavy
(170 kDa) and light (35- 3t kDa) subunits 1nked by disulfide bonds. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) raiscd against a light subunit-glutathsone-S-transferase fusion protcin were used to probe its structure
and function. Iour light subunit-specific mAb were produced which recognized distinct epitopes on five diflerent
light subunit isoforms. Immunoblots with thesc nAb demonstrated co-migration of light and hcavy subunits
when nonreduced trophozoite proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that thc subunits do not exist
free of the heterodimer in significant quantitics. While anti-heavy subunit antibodies had previously been shown
to alter adherence, anti-light subunit antibodies did not, suggesting that the heavy subunit contains the
carbohydrate recognition domain.
