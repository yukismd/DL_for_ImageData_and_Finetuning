Peter A.Danelo joined the firm in 1988 and has a general civil litigation practice
Experience: Mr.Danelo is an experienced trial attorney, emphasizing complex civil
cases and appellate matters. He has been the lead attorney responsible for numerous
class actions, contract disputes, construction cases, product liability claims, fraud
actions, environmental suits, and bankruptcy-related litigation. In his 24-year career, he
has spent approximately 3 1/2 years in trial, including several arbitrations and jury and
non-jury trials in federal and state courts.
Attached is a description of Mr.Danelos most significant trials. All but two of the eight
involved the direct and cross-examination by Mr.Danelo of significant technical,
scientific, or engineering experts. Economic or accounting experts also testified in most
of these trials. One of these suits (Asarco adv. Louisiana-Pacific, et al.) was a four-month
jury trial of a products-liability case. Mr. Danelo has other products liability experience,
primarily for Cincinnati Milacron, a manufacturer of machine tools. He has represented
it in three actions in the last several years, all of which were successfully disposed of
before trial.
Mr.Danelo is a frequent speaker at legal seminars, addressing such topics as federal and
state RICO claims, the use of economic experts in commercial litigation, and seeking or
opposing injunctive relief. He has chaired several legal seminars, including one at
which most of Seattle's trial and appellate federal judges spoke. He served on the King
County Bar Association's Judicial Screening Committee and the Federal Bar
Association's Continuing Legal Education Committee, and has been a faculty member
of the National Institute for Trial Advocacy

The mortality attributabie to ischemic heart disease as a result of cigarette
smoking is greater than that due to lung cancer.Between 1972 and1974,in a
prospective study of a community of older adults in southem Califonis, the
authors tested the hypothesis that nonsmoking women exposed to their hus.
band's cigarette smoke would have an elevated risk of fatal ischemic heart
disease.Married women aged 50-79 years who had never smoked cigarettes (n
=695) were classified according to the husband's self-reported smoking status
at entry into the study never, former, or current smoker. After 10 years, non-
smoking wives of current or former cigarette smokers had a higher total p
0.05)and.age-adjusted (p  0.10) death rate from ischemic heart disease than
women whose husbands never smoked.After adjustment for differences in risk
factors for heart disease, the relative risk for death from ischemic heart disease
in nonsmoking women mamied to current or former cigarette smokers was 14.9
p  0.10).These data are compatible with the hypothesis that passive cigarette
smoking carries an excess risk of fatal ischemic heart disease.

Background:
The purpose of the Philip Morris External Research Program is to support the highest quality research that
contributes to our fundamental scientific knowledge, helps address the concerns of the public health community
product design(s) that might reduce the health risk of smoking. Any ongoing research performed under contract in
support of Philip Morris RD&E projects which deals with proprietary information would not be included in this
program. Philip Morris will only fund proposals submitted to the External Research Program that have been
recommended by the Science Advisory Board

Activities of 5-Methylfurfuryltrimethylammonium

Abstract-5-Methylfurfuryltrimethylammonium iodide (5-MFT) is a
furan analog of muscarine and was studied for its cholinergic
activity at vascular endothelial receptors of the rat aorta. Other
related compounds have different substitutions at position 5 of
the furan ring and include the following compounds: 5-hydroxy-
methy-5-HMFT5-chloromethyl-5-CMFT.5-bromomethyl-
5-BMFT).5-iodomethyl-5-1MFT.and5-methoxy-5-MOFT
furfuryltrimethylammonium salts. The furan analogs relaxed helical
strips of rat aorta which contracted with norepinephrine (10-6M).
These relaxations were endothelial cell-dependent.The ED's for
muscarinic activities increased in the following order:5-MFT=ACh
dl-muscarine 5-HMFT=5-CMFT5-MOFT5-BMFT
5-IMFT.Among the furan analogs.5-MFT was found to be a full
agonist at the endothelial cells:other furan analogs were only partial
agonists. The affinities and relative intrinsic efficacies of the most
potent analogs decreased in the following order:ACh =5-MFT>
dl-muscarine >5-HMFT>5-CMFT.
Atropine and scopolamine antagonized relaxations by furan
analogs. K values for atropine and scopolamine against ACh.
5-MFT or 5-HMFT as agonist were not different,indicating that
these agonists and antagonists were acting at the same muscarinic
receptors.The K of atropine and of scopolamine increased when
5-CMFT was used as an agonist, indicating that 5-CMFT may
cause relaxation by acting at other sites besides endothelial
muscarinic receptors.The endothelial muscarinic receptor might be
classified tentatively as of M or Mtype.These studies did not
exclude the possible heterogeneity of the endothelial muscarinic
receptors.

Philip Morris will now become the model corporate citizen which it now claims to be.
Effective deterrence involves more than just prohibiting conduct, and requires changing mindsets.
Philip Morris has, in the past, demonstrated a willingness and ability to achieve its ends by creative
means and the Court cannot predict what those means might in the future be for a corporation with
enormous resources profiting from the sale of a life threatening product. Philip Morris can, of course,
continue to lawfully sell its product, but it must do so with a mindset far different from that evidenced
by its corporate history to date.Such a sea change may have begun to occur at Philip Morris

proper to prevent Philip Morrisreturn to the old mindset or its crafting of ever-more ingenious ways to

Functional impairment of the crythrocytes could be attributed to the alterations in the membrane
lipids composition leading to morphological changes. Propane-1,2-diol ingestionto male adult rats at
adoselevel of 284 1per 100 gm. body weight for 30days has been shown to deplete the membrane
cholesterol and phospholipids. This led to thc cbanges in thc red ceil morphology as visualized under
Electron microscope.
INTRODUCTION
The architecture of the red cell membrane is regulated mainly by the composition
of lipids and proteins,Kirby & Green,I980). The cxposure to a grcat variety of
amphillic agents in vitro induces theformation of spiculated or spurred cellsRobins&
Miller,1974) and Vatsala & Singh.1980.Both depletion and repletion of cholesterol has
an effect on membrane surface and caused a change in the shape of red cells. Studies
with Propane-1,2-diol (PG) a widely used solvent in drug,pharmaceutics and food
industry showed that this solvent at a dose level of284 l in water per 100 gm.body
weight to adult male albino rats for 30 days, caused significant lowering ofplasma and
blood lipids,Amma et al.,(1978). This observation led us to study the effect of ingestion
of this solvent on the red cell morphology and membrane lipids.

Tar and Nicotine by Brand lists
The Corp.Affairs Web Team is trying to find out who is the original author of PM USA's Tar and Nicotine brand by brand
list. Since the launch of pmusa.com, we have worked with Maria Buonaventura and Kathy Mulligan to update our brand by
brand list based on information that comes to them from the list Joe Murillo approves for disclosure.
However, we would like to get in touch with the original authors/keepers of the list. For exampie, does marketing generate
and keep the list; does legal generate and keep the list for disclosure purposes; does Richmond keep the list as part of its
research arm;or is it an MSA generated list to which T&N values are added for reporting purposes, etc....?
The information is needed as part of our cross-functional project to consolidate pack style descriptions on our Ingredients
by brand and T&N by brand.
Thanks,

A Role for RNA Synthesis in Homologous Pairing Events

:
The relationship between RNA synthesis and homologous pairing in vitro, catalyzed by RecA protein, was
examined by using an established strand transfer assay system. When a short DNA duplex is mixed with
.
single-stranded circles, RecA protein promotes the transfer of the minus strand of the duplex onto the
complementary region of the plus-strund circle, with the displacement of the plus strand of the duplex.
However, if minus-strand RNA is synthesized from the duplex pairing partner joint molecules containing the
:
RNA transcript, the plus strand of the DNA duplex, and the plus-strand circle are also observed to form.This
.
reaction, which is dependent on RNA polymerase, sequence homology and RecA proteinproduces a joint
molecule that can be dissolved by treatment with RNase H but not RNase A.Under these reaction conditions,
s-
product molecules form even when the length of shared homology between duplex and circle is reduced to 15 bp.
.
Among thc most important phases of the recombination

INTRODUCTION
Protein kinase C PKc).the Ca2+ and phospholipid dependent kinase,belongs to the family of
protein serine/threorine kinases. It is an important enzyme in mediating cell growth, cell differentiation
and tumor promotion (1,2).Physiologically,PKC is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG generated during
phosphatidylinosito!(Pl) tumover.Metabolism of Pl is usually initiated by the action of phospholipase C in
response to extracellular factors including hormones,growth factors and neurotransmitters.In addition to
DAG, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is generated during PI turnover. While DAG activates PKC,IP3
moblizes intracellular Ca2+(3).Tumor promoting phorbol esters,such as phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate
PMA),directly activates PKC by a mechanism similar to that of DAG 3.
mimics the effect of PMA and increases surace expression of the allb3 integrin and enhances tumor
cell adhesion to endothelium and subendothelial matrix (4). This implies a protein kinase C mediated
mechanism of action for 12(S)-HETE. In fact a number of fatty acids including arachidonic acid and some
of its metabolites [including 12(S)-HETE] are able to directly activate protein kinase C in vitro (5-9).
Recently we reported that 12(S)-HETE increased adhesion to endothelium of rat Walker 256
carcinosarcoma W256 cells by activation of PKC 10
Tumor cell metastasis is a multi-step process involving interactions among tumor cells and host
cells (11,12).We reported that subpopulations of cells, differing in their lung colonization potentials,
could be isolated from B16a amelanotic melanoma B16a tumors by centrifugal elutriation (13).A
cathepsin B and L (15,16) in these B16a subpopulations.In this study,we compared the levels of PKC
and 12(S)-HETE in these subpopulations. We also studied the effect of 12(S)-HETE on their adhesion
to the matrix protein tibronectin. Finally, the involvement of PKC in adhesion to tibronectin was
investigated by using protein kinase inhibitors.

""The protective role of cigarette smoking during exposure to pollutants.""
rette smoking during exposures to pollutants, viz, that clearance of
pollutants is facilitated following smoking; mucus produced by cigarette
smoke exposures provides a shield to underlying sensitive cells; and/or
cigarette smoking produces a thickening of bronchial epithelium which
also shields underlying sensitive cells. Data examining these hypotheses
are derived from previous studies of dogs exposed to radon, uranium
ore dust and cigarette smoke. In these studies it was noted that sig-
nificantly fewer lung cancers occurred in the smoking group otherwise
similarly exposed to radon and uranium ore dust. Similar carcinogenic
data exist in certain miner populations. Histopathologic and morpho-
metric data regarding mucus cell populations and epithelial thickness
in the trachea and bronchi of these animals will be presented.""

Glaxo Wellcome Research Director for Europe
Jonathan Knowies was appointed director of the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology in Geneva in
1989. Over the last five years under his leadership, the 180-strong Institute has developed significant
expertise in the diverse technologies essential for the discovery and detinition of important novel drug
targets. It has made a significant contribution to Glaxo's intemational drug discovery effort, and
is responsible for the intemational co-ordination of the Glaxo Human Genetics Initiative.In 1995, in
addition to his function as Director of the Glaxo Institute at Geneva, he was appointed as Research
Director for Glaxo Welicome Europe. He is also a member of the Global Research and Development
Executive Committee, which oversees all Glaxo Wellcome Research and Development activities
world-wide.
Before joining Glaxo, Jonathan Knowles was head of molecular biology at the Technical Research
Centre of Finland for 10 years.He directed a multidisciplinary group exploiting molecular biology for
the development of new proteins and industrial organisms for biotech applications in the production of
tood, paper, dlagnostics and pharmaceuticals. He has a broad interest in biology and in particular its
applications which he has pursued in research organisations in the UK, France, Germany, the US,
Finland, Japan, and Switzerland.

ABSTRacr: Kinesin was extensively purified from bovine brain cytosol by a microtubule-binding step in
the presence of 5-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP).followed by gel filtration chromatography and
sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.The products consistently contained 124000 (124K) and 64000 (64K)
dalton polypeptides.These two polypeptides appear to represent heavy and light chains of kinesinrespectively,
because they copurified on sucrose gradients to a constant and equimolar stoichiometry and bound stably
to microtubules in the prescnce of AMP-PNP but not ATP.The mobilities of 124K and 64K in sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions were the same as under nonreducing conditions.
A diffusion coefficient of (2.24  0.21)  10 cm s and a sedimentation cocfficient of (9.56  0.34)
10-13s wcre determined for native kincsin by gel filtration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation,
respectively. These values were used to calculate a native molecular weight of about 379 000 and suggest
that kinesin has an axial ratio of approximately 20. Extensively purified kinesin exhibited microtubule-
activated ATPase activity,and only the 124K subunit incorporated ATP in photoaffinity labeling experiments
using [p]ATP. Collectively, these data favor the interpretation that bovine brain kinesin is a highly
elongated, microtubule-activated ATPasc comprising two subunits each of 124 000 and 64 000 daltons, that
the subunits are not linked to one another by disulfide bonds, and that the heavy chains are the ATP-binding
subunits.

Prevention of Nicotine Intoxication by Catatoxic Steroids
H.SELYE,E.YECHIAYAN AND I.MECS
Institute of Experimental Medicine and SurgeryUniversity of Montreal.Montreal.Caneda
Abstract-In rats, severe and almost always fatal nicotine intoxication
can be prevented by various catatoxic steroids such as ethylestrenol,
norbolethone, SC-11927, spironolactone and oxandrolone. Conversely,
steroids previously shown not to possess catatoxic actions in other test
systems, fail to protect against nicotine poisoning.
Introduction
The pharmacologic classification of steroids is based upon the fact that some
of their actions are separable and independent, whereas others are merely
inseparable subordinate manifestations of one of these basic activities (1).For
example, the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid, luteoid
or gestogenic) and anesthetic effects of steroids are independent of each
other; conversely,the antiphlogistic, thymolytic and ACTH-secretion-inhibiting
actions are not separable from glucocorticoid activity, in that no steroid of this
latter group possesses one such subordinate manifestation without also exhibiting
the others.It has long been known that adrenalectomy decreases the resistance
to. most toxic agents, whereas substitution therapy with corticoids restores it
towards normal by combating nonspecific stress; yet, overdosage with corticoids
is singularly ineffective in raising the nonspecific resistance of intact animals
above normal, presumably because a near optimal corticoid supply is assured
by the physiologic activity of the adrenal cortex 2).
However, several reports from this laboratory have shown that certain
steroids (not necessarily endowed with corticoid potency) can protect the
th adrenal cortex. For example, these ""catatoxic steroidsfrom the Greek
kata = down,against)3) can induce resistance against steroid anesthesia (4,
pentylenetetrazol convulsions (5),the calcinosis elicited by vitamin-D compounds
6-8) digitoxin poisoning 9).the hypnotic action of pentobarbital and methy-
prylon (10)the adrenal necrosis produced by 7,12-dimethylbenzaanthracene
(11. and the perforating jejunal ulcers with peritonitis elicited in the rat by
indomethacin overdosage (12).

Molecular size heterogeneity of ferritin in mouse liver
William H. Massover
Department of Anatomy, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)- New Jersey Medical School
100 Bergen Street, Newark, NJ 07103 (U.S.A.)
(Received November 12th, 1984)
Key words: Ferritin; Isoferritin; Iron metabolism; Heterogeneity; (Mouse liver)
As much as 4% of the total protein in pure liver ferritin from mice with short-term parenteral iron overload
produces a minor band migrating anodally to the major (alpha) band of holoferritin with non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The components in this minor band and the alpha band have been isolated
to purity by preparative electrophoretic fractionation. The protein in the minor band is ferritin, since it
contains ferric iron and fulfills defining criteria at the level of biochemistry, immunology and ultrastructure.
Native polyacrylamide electrophoresis with pore-size-gradient gels shows that the ferritin molecules in the
minor band have a slightly smaller diameter than the holoferritin in the alpha band. Isoelectric focusing
reveals that the smaller ferritin has an identical number and range of charge isomers (p/ 4.9-5.3) as the
larger ferritin, but the relative amount of each size class within some isoferritin bands differs. The smaller
ferritin molecules are structurally intact and are rade from polypeptide subunits with M, 18 000; the larger
ferritin molecules have subunits with M, 22000. The minor species of hepatic ferritin thus has a smaller
molecular size because it is made mainly from smaller subunits. No minor electrophoretic band can be
detected in liver ferritin obtained from mice with normal iron levels. These results demonstrate that siderosis
induces the formation of molecular size polymorphism (macroheterogeneity) in mouse liver ferritin. The new
smaller hepatic ferritin could serve to redistribute excess iron into the main storage organs during the early
response to iron overload, since it appears to be identical to one of the two types of serum ferritin molecules
present in these siderotic mice.

As you can see,complaints A and B were included in Ms.Kawamura's memo of March 7,
1996. Complaints A and B were settled amicably with talks that were carried out several
times and by compensating several cartons of normal products together with SP goods
Presently, we are talking and negotiating with the consumer who made complaint for
settlement. In the meantime, our sales force visited him and confirmed that the burning
occurred in his new Mercedes Benz car where the filter falled off of our products.

INTRODUCTION
Lecithin-cholesterolacyltransferase (LCAT)(EC2.3.1.43)is a plasma enzyme
which catalyzes esterification of cholesterol on high-density lipoproteins (HDL)
by transferring a fatty acid from the C-2 position of phosphatidyl choline to free
cholesterol (Glomset,1968.HDL apoprotein A-1 is an important cofactor in this
reaction (Ficlding and Fielding.1971:Soutar elal.. 1975).Although the metabolic
significance of the LCAT reaction has not been completely elucidated.Glomset
1979) has postulated that LCAT may be involved in the removal of excess phos-
pholipid and free cholesterol from lipoprotein remnants and may participate in the
mobilization of cholesterol from peripheral cell membranes and its subsequent
transport to the liver.
HDL serves as the lipoprotein substrate for LCAT and may also have
antiatherogenic properties related to its ability to remove cholesterol from extra
hepatic tissue Glomset and Norum.1973:Glomset.1979).Numerous epidemio-
logical studies have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between HDL
cholesterol concentration and the incidence of coronary heart disease (Gordon el
l.. 1977:Castelli et al.. 1977).A similar correlation also exists between coronary
heart disease and HDL's major protein component. apoprotein A-1 Berg e/ al..
1976). Much recent attention has focused on HDL levels and established heart
disease risk. factors such as cigarette smoking Enger el al.. 1977: Hulley et l..
1979Berg l..1979:Garrison ctl.1978.Results from these studies show that
smoking reduces HDL cholesterol (Enger et al..1977: Hulley et l.. 1979Garri-
son et l.. 1978) and apoprotein A-1 and A-ll levels (Berg et al.. 1979.

A teratologic suppressor role for

DNA damage may mediate birth defects caused by many drugs and environmental
critically embryoprotective. We have studied the effects of the environmental teratogen,
benzo[a]pyrene, on pregnant heterozygous p53-deficient mice.Such mice exhibited
between 2- to 4-fold higher embryotoxicity and teratogenicity than normal p53-controls.
Fetal resorptions reflecting in utero death were genotyped using the polymerase chain
reaction and found to be increased 2.6-fold and 3.6-fold respectively with heterozygous
and homozygous p53-deficient embryos. These results provide the first direct evidence
that p53 may be an important teratological suppressor gene which protects the embryo
from DNA-damaging chemicals and developmental oxidative stress.
